westcoastcollaborative.org,,Quasigovernmental,,accepted term,"THE WEST COAST COLLABORATIVE The West Coast Collaborative (Collaborative) is an ambitious public-private partnership between leaders from federal, state, and local government, the private sector, academia, and environmental groups committed to reducing diesel emissions and advancing clean air technologies and practices along the West Coast of North America. The Collaborative is part of the National Clean Diesel Campaign (NCDC), which seeks to advance strategies to reduce diesel emissions and move toward cleaner air by working with diesel fleet, engine and emission control technology owners, operators, developers and manufacturers; air quality professionals; environmental and community organizations; and federal, state and local officials. To advance diesel  emission reductions, Congress Authorized funding for clean diesel activities in the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) as part of the 2005 Energy Policy Act. The Collaborative aims to reduce diesel emissions through verified and certified technologies, engines and practices, and advances innovative emission reduction technologies and practices. The Collaborative also helps coordinate regional efforts for cleaner fuels and the Clean School Bus USA program. EPA launched, but does not control the Collaborative. n  From https://www.westcoastcollaborative.org/about.htm ; Retrieved December 23, 2016 -- Note added 12/23/16 21:12",https://www.westcoastcollaborative.org/,12/23/16 20:36
